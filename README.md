# Two-Way-Binding-LWC
What is Two Way Binding in LWC?

LWC supports one-way binding by deafult i.e From Javascript we can assign values to HTML.
But to get values from HTML to JS file we have to use attribues like data-id/data-prop-value/lwc:ref.
This is know as two-way binding i.e from JS to HTML and HTML to JS
